        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I grew up always interested in science and technology, but my love for engineering really
            kicked off when I first joined a LEGO robotics team in primary school. Not only did I learn
            some technical skills, like block programming, I also learned that I loved the process
            of learning alongside peers and mentors.
            <br><br>
            After acting as the Controls Lead of my First Robotics Competition (FRC) team 5985, I landed
            on a passion for control systems engineering in particular. For that reason, I chose to
            specialise in electronics engineering to get as much exposure to control systems as possible.
            Robotics was a great opportunity for me to build a broad set of engineering skills, but I'm
            also excited to build a specialisation in electronics.
            <br><br>
            In my professional life, I've worked at Spot X Underwater Vision, where I worked on exciting
            products for the sub-sea industry, delivering underwater camera systems of varying complexity
            to research and commercial clients. I really enjoyed the flexibility of working on the
            mechanical, electrical, and software sides of product development, and the experience working
            on effective production documentation and my lessions learned designing for assembly efficiency
            was really valuable.
            <br><br>
            I am currently working at Laserdyne Technologies, but I am always looking for exciting projects,
            new products to develop, or ways to help make manufacturing more efficient. I also do small
            engineering projects as an independent consultant. <b>Please reach out if you are interested in
            working together!</b>
            <br><br>
            Eventually I hope to be doing some impactful work as a control systems engineer. I love the sub-sea
            industry in particular, and I hope to get the opportunity to make some waves in the field
            one day, and apply my knowledge from the defence industry to really move sub-sea forward.
            There are plenty of opportunities and unsolved problems, which I would also love to hear about!
